# TiProxySettingReader

Read HTTP proxy settings from iOS.

## Background

When using TCP sockets in Titanium for HTTP/HTTPS communications the iOS proxy settings are not respected by default. As a developer you will have to do that yourself. This simple module allows you to retrieve the HTTP proxy settings from iOS so you can let your software act accordingly.
